- 👋 Hello, I’m @pkanakam
- 👀 Suddenly, I realized I'm overweight and thought about shedding few pounds as a kick start to my weight loss journey. Hah!!! it dawned on me that first thing to do is to weigh myself followed by keeping a track of what goes intp my mouth, specifically in terms of items and calories, added in a workout, calculated the calories burnt and calories consumed, made some analysis of what needs to be thrown out of my pantry,followed through the routine of analysis and had an outcome of losing few pounds. Hooray! data and its analysis helped me to make key decisions and meet my goals. This opened my eyes to the fact of the omnipresence of data and the way its storage and analysis can help us reap its obvious benefits. So, moved into the data world and want to expand on it more. In short I'm on a journey to learn the use of Python in the data world and they way it can be used to help the customers of a Data enthusiast like me.
- 🌱 As mentioned above, I have just started learning Python and want to expand more of my coding and data analysis skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on to discuss more about python and its use on data analysis, automation and usage of its libraries and modules for even website creation
